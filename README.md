# hoi4_csa
This is my confederacy mod.  I am still actively working on it, but it is in a completely playable state.

How to play?

Start a game as the USA.  There is a new event that will trigger within 10 days.  If you choose to end segregation, the south will secede.  At that point you can choose to play for the US or the confederacy.  The US will declare war.  Capitulate the US 10% to get a white peace and start your journey as an independent CSA.  Or you can choose to continue fighting and conquer the USA.  The Confederates can pretty easily take Washington, which will get the war score it needs.  From the USA perspective, equipment wise the CSA isn't in a position to field more than the 24 divisions they conscript on event.  So the USA can just overwhelm them once they get organized. 

If you are a USA player, you aren't forced to offer a white peace, you can refuse to offer terms if the CSA gets their war score goal.

Notes:
Known Bugs:

After Man the Guns….the time it takes for the CSA to raise the 24 volunteer divisions when the war starts, seems a little excessive.  Will have to look into this.

Compatibility.
Mods that wont be compatible:
- mods that modify states.  (The core states of the confederacy specifically).
- mods that modify nation colors.  (had to add an entry for the CSA).
- mods that modify the neutral ideology.  (I made neutrality boost-able) mods that add new ideologies or modify the other 3 should be compatible as it reloads the neutral ideology in its own file.

Anything else should be fairly compatible.

####Current Status####

Graphics: (I currently have no plans of creating custom models, textures yes, models no as I am not a modeler)
Map Sprites:
	Infantry – based on UK/USA with unique CSA skins.   (including custom skins for para, mountain, marines).
	Equipment – Custom skins added for tanks and planes.

Tech Tree:
	Tech Tree uses British images.  I created unique images for jets.  And tweaked the sprites to give them a unique feel for the confederacy.

Ideas: 
	Created/Cannibalized Company logos.
	Theorists/High Command/Army, Navy, Air Chiefs/Advisers use generic icons.  (Added some custom icons for Generals/Admirals)

Faction Leaders:
	Custom faction leader images based on historical figures.

Flags:
	Unique flags.

Textual representation:
Political Leaders:
	Unique names based on historical figures.

Politics:
	Unique names based on historical organizations.

Tech Tree / Equipment:
	All equipment has unique flavor names with historical Confederate Arms manufacturers.

Events
	Custom events added for Secession/Civil war/Negating Pax Americana.  

Focuses
	CSA: Custom Focus Tree Added! Alpha version.  Army Navy Industry are fairly generic still, but added some fun custom diplomatic trees.

I am open to suggestions.  With that said it is not my intent to get crazy with this mod.  My goal is a fully fleshed out Confederacy within the context of the base game. Which ideally will help in making it compatible with other mods.
